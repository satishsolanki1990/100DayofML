import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# read the data
df=pd.read_csv('Data_day1.csv')

# Preprocessing:
# 1. Histogram : to see the data distribution

# 2. Data visualization

# 3. missing data: there are two ways (1) delete that raw (2) use mean variance to assign value

# 4. Categorical data encoder


# 5. feature Scaling or  Normalization: there are many ways to normalize, every technique has
# its limitation and strength. Following techniques are usually followed
#   (1). Max-min normalization
#   (2). mean/variance normalization or mean/std normalization
#   (3). log normalization
#   (4).


# 6. feature selection : based on histogram or Heatmap

# 7. dataset split (test/train/val)
